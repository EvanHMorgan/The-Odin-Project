# The Odin Project Repository

## Summary

Thanks!

## About Me

I am learning front-end web development after spending about 12 years working in creative teams for a corporate photo studio as a graphic designer, print layout artist, and eventually went into a sales management role for a long, long time.  I also have a business admin degree, but I'm looking forward to working within creative teams again as a front-end dev\designer.  These are my efforts to expand my skills beyond graphic design and pick up coding. Enjoy.


## Projects

This project is a website built for the game Counter-Strike Global Offensive. The concept is a strat book to help random players in pickup games organize and play together strategically while encouraging teamwork.
