## Summary

This project is a website built for Counter-Strike Global Offensive. The concept is a strat book to help random players in pickup games organize and play together strategically while encouraging teamwork.

## How it Works

Players in pick up games can simply link to this site and call the specific strat they want to run.  The other players in the game can look up that strat and a video with their role in the strat will play so they know which routes to take and which nades to throw.  The app is meant to be utilized during real-time gameplay, so the goals of the app are to be fast and easy to use, not have any fluff, and allow for players to pull up videos and watch the tutorial during their time spent when dead, or during the buy time at the beginning of each round before it starts.
